        <h1>The following are some ideas for the new Django "It Worked" page.</h1>

        <p>The general idea of these "mock-ups" is to have a simple, clean design with an illustration/animation
        of Django's namesake, guitarist Django Reinhardt.</p>

        <p>The font (Roboto) and colors of the mock-ups attempt to reflect the design of the https://www.djangoproject.com/ website.
        The Django Animation links to a wikipedia article on Reinhardt.</p>

        <p>Also the animation is copyright Cornelius Joksch (http://www.corneliusjoksch.de/). He has said that we
        can use his animation of Django free of charge as long as we can come to a proper
      agreement regarding attribution on the "It works" page. One idea is to put a
    credit directly under the animation (which I've done in the mockups). Again, though promising, we are still in talks,
  so no guarantee we can use his animation just yet.</p>

        <h6>Note: The CSS is being created "mock-up" style. Meaning attention is solely on the
          design output and not on the code quality during this stage of design "trial and error."</h6>
          <h6>Eventually everything will be inlined and embedded in the HTML, so the page doesn't need to call
          any resources. For example, for these mockups the animation was converted to a data:uri and the Django logo is an svg.</h6>
