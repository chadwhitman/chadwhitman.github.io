# Concerning the new Django Project "install success" page:
Current issues can be found here: https://github.com/chadwhitman/chadwhitman.github.io/issues

An example of what the install page will look like can be found here: https://chadwhitman.github.io/congrats/django/

Note, I decided to put an example up here on github via my personal page because it was an easy way to get a free server/domain for as long as we need it. ;)
